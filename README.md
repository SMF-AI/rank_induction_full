## 🧠 Overview

**Rank Induction** is a training strategy for Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) that leverages expert annotations using a **ranking constraint**—rather than exact attention matching—to guide the model’s focus toward diagnostically meaningful areas.  By ranking annotated lesion patches higher than non-lesion patches, our method guides the model to focus on diagnostically meaningful regions without over-constraining attention distribution.

> ⚠️ Most MIL methods either ignore expert annotations or enforce overly strict attention constraints.  
> ✅ Our method strikes a balance by ranking annotated lesion patches higher than non-lesion ones—offering better interpretability and performance, especially in low-data regimes.

## 🔬 Key iead

Most classic MIL methods only assume that the presence of at least one `positive` patch makes a slide positive, with no guidance on how *important* each patch is. In contrast, Rank Induction uses expert annotations (patches that are known to be lesion or non-lesion) to induce a pairwise *ranking* preference:

- **Lesion patches** should have **higher** attention scores than
- **Non-lesion patches**.

Formally, for lesion patches \( s_i \) and non-lesion patches \( s_j \), we want:
```math
s_i > s_j \quad \text{for all} \; (i, j) \;\text{where} \; y_i = 1, \; y_j = 0.
```
### Pairwise Probability

To implement this, we convert the **score difference** into a pairwise probability \( P_{i,j} \):

```math
    P_{i,j} \;=\; \frac{1}{1 + \exp\big[-\sigma ( s_i - s_j - m )\big]},
```

where
- $s_i$ and $s_j$ are the **raw** attention score (before softmax),
- $\sigma$ is a scaling factor,
- $m$ is a margin to encourage a significant gap between lesion and non-lesion attention scores.

### Rank Loss

We define the **Rank Loss** $\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{rank}$ by comparing the predicted pairwise probability \($P_{i,j}$\) against the ground-truth preference \($\bar{P}_{i,j} \in \{0,1\} $\) (which indicates which patch should be ranked higher):

```math
\mathcal{L}_{\text{rank}} 
    = \frac{1}{|\mathcal{P}|} \sum_{(i,j)\in \mathcal{P}}
    -\bar{P}_{i,j} \,\log P_{i,j} \;-\; \bigl(1 - \bar{P}_{i,j}\bigr)\,\log\bigl(1 - P_{i,j}\bigr),
```

where \($\mathcal{P}$\) contains all valid (lesion–non-lesion) patch index pairs.  
Finally, the **slide-level classification objective** (e.g., binary cross-entropy) and the rank loss are jointly optimized.
